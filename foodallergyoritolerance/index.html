                            <p>It is fairly commonplace to have a reaction to a specific food but in the majority of cases it is an intolerance rather that an allergy. It matters to know the difference between an allergy and an intolerance as although they may have similar symptoms, a food allergy can be more serious.</p>

                            <p>Food Allergy is an instant and possibly serious response by your immune system to even the smallest amount of food, this response happens every time you eat the food. It is merely your body's way of trying to fight off a foreign invader it sees to be dangerous.</p>
                            <p>Your body is wired to spot antigens which are foreign objects that your body has decided may be harmful. As soon as these antigens are spotted, a reaction is triggered to get them out of your body as quickly as possible, before anything bad can happen. However, your body is not always so good at figuring out what is a dangerous invader and what is not. When it makes a mistake and over reacts to a foreign invader, the triggered immune response is called an allergic reaction. This reaction gives rise in minutes or even seconds to allergy symptoms such as a rash, wheezing or itching and in rare cases, anaphylaxis.</p>                        
                            <p>The most common food allergies in adults are to fish, shellfish, peanuts, walnuts, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts and brazil nuts. Children quite often have allergies to milk and eggs as well as to peanuts, tree nuts and fish.</p>

                            <p>Food Intolerance is more commonplace. The symptoms of food intolerance tend to come on gradually, often many hours after eating the problem food. In some of us symptoms may only happen when a lot of the food is eaten or when the food is eaten frequently, or craved. It is also possible to be intolerant to several different foods.</p>
                            <p>An overgrowth of @this.Html.ActionLink("Candida Albicans", "candida", "home")  can trigger intolerance to a certain food.</p>
                            <p>Symptoms of food intolerance are wide ranging, such as; digestive problems, headaches, sleeping problems, hay fever, aching muscles and joints, skin problems, anxiety and stress, frequent colds, weight fluctuation, low self esteem and mood swings to name but a few</p>
                            <p>The most common food intolerances are: dairy, soya, wheat and gluten found in wheat, rye and barley.</p>
                            <p>Food intolerance is not life threatening.</p>
