                            <p>You will be asked to fill out a questionnaire, which is private and cofidential, to bring with you to the first session. This gives me a chance to look at your medical history, your symptoms and to see what your diet and lifestyle is like. In the assessment session your arm muscles are tested using Kinesiology as you lie on a couch, the approach is gentle, safe and not intrusive and the results are known at once.</p>
