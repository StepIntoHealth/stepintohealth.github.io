                            <h2>It is easy for us to forget that good health can be more than just the absence of disease.</h2>
                            <p>We may cope with daily life but all too often with a background of minor ills and feelings of being 'tired all the time' we get used to living below par and forget the possibility of positive good health and buoyant energy. Increasingly today it is being recognised that health-care is as much to do with prevention of disease as with cure, and that we each have the choice of rediscovering and maintaining our optimum health. Given a little help, our bodies have an extraordinarily capacity to recover.</p>
