                            <h2>What is subtle energy?</h2>
                            <p>Thousands of years ago Chinese tradition spoke of the existence of universal energy fields that surrounded and interconnected all living things and that the energy fields surrounding the physical body interacted with it by flowing through energy channels. They called this vital life force energy c'hi and they called the energy channels in which c'hi flowed throughout the body; meridians.</p>
                            <p>The ancient tradition of the Hindus also spoke of the existence of universal energy fields and of the vital life force energy, they called this energy prana. They too spoke of this energy that surrounded and interacted with the physical body by moving through concentrated spirals or energy centres which they called chakras, into energy channels in the body they called nadis.</p>

                                <h2>The importance of subtle energy.</h2>
                                <p>Both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Hindus believed this subtle energy to be vitally important for the functioning of the organs in the human body. They also believed there was a spiritual part to this energy as well that was indestructible and also vital to the well being of everyone.</p>
                                <p>This unseen energy, or subtle energy, was thought to be the root of life and thought to balance with the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of life to nourish the body and mind to keep a person well. Maintained good health was thought to be dependent on this subtle energy flowing freely and in perfect balance.</p>

                                    <p>We are all born with c'hi inherited from our parents and c’hi is created from the environment; the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. All of these factors affect the balance of c'hi which flows continuously throughout the body in a network of meridians. Each meridian takes its name from the organ or gland of the body that it regulates.</p>
                                    <p>The cycle of c'hi begins it's daily flow in the Lung meridian at 3am and as all the meridians are connected to one another, c'hi moves in a particular direction from one meridian to the next in one unbroken flow, constantly moving in a cycle.</p>

                                    <p>In this cycle c'hi flows through each meridian once every twenty four hours, taking two hours to pass through each one, and so, for two hours of the day c'hi achieves its best performance and is most active, and twelve hours later c'hi flows at its minimum (for two hours) and is less active. This cycle is known as the Chinese Body Clock.</p>
                                    <p>As each meridian is connected to the organ or gland it regulates, organ and gland functions ebb and flow every twenty four hours, therefore there is a two hour period when the organ/gland is at its most active and twelve hours later at it's less active.</p>

                            <h2>The meridians.</h2>
                            <p>Looking at the ancient Chinese philosophy behind yin and yang which tells us that 'the whole' is composed of the union of opposites that are complementary and interdependent, the meridians are divided into yin (passive) and yang (active) pairs or partners with which they work together. Each meridian is seen to be predominately yin or predominately yang, and each yang meridian needs its paired yin meridian for its completion, and each yin meridian needs to be balanced by its paired yang meridian.</p>

                            <p>There are twelve main meridians<span class="hidden-xs"> (as above)</span> which take their name from the organ/gland they regulate. Each meridian passing through one side of the body has a mirror image on the other side, resulting in twelve pairs. In addition to these twelve main meridians there are also two vessel meridians. These are not paired and are known as the governing vessel and conception vessel. These meridians act as energy (c’hi) reservoirs storing and supplying energy to the meridian network.</p>

                            <p>When c'hi is blocked and stagnant and not flowing freely in a meridian it will not be able to fully activate that organ it regulates or continue with enough intensity to benefit the next meridian/organ. An imbalance in the flow of c'hi in the energy system of the body can eventually result in health problems because this life force energy is not fed correctly to the tissues and cells of the body.</p>

                            <p>Meridian tracing is a technique that can be used to either sedate or stimulate the flow of energy in the meridian to help restore the balance of subtle energy (c'hi) in the body of their client</p>
                            <p>Each meridian is closely connected to the nervous system of the body and stress and illness can cause disturbance in the signals of the nervous system. Correcting or balancing the meridian system also benefits the nervous system and therefore the body's own communication system (the nervous system) enables the body to function more effectively.</p>
                            <p>As each Meridian is also energetically connected to a muscle or muscles of the body - strengthening the muscle/s concerned, through simple exercises, will improve the flow of cc'hi energy in the meridian and in turn the function of the organ it serves<p>
