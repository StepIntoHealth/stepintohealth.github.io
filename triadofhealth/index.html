                            <p>The body is one natural whole with many different systems and functions that link together and communicate with each other, the nervous system, the meridian system, the lymphatic system and the vascular system, for example. The body should therefore be treated as one system as a whole, as opposed to a collection of parts.</p>
                            <p>The three aspects of the Triad of Health are the main aspects that influence health and is represented as an equilateral triangle. Each of the aspects of the Triad of Health interacts with each other, and all three aspects need to function well, and be in balance with each other for someone to be completely healthy.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding poor health.</h2>
                            <p>When a person experiences poor health it is due to an imbalance in one or more of the three aspects of the triad of health. Whether it is a physical injury or illness, emotional stress or a poor diet, because the three aspects of the triad of health interactive with one another an imbalance in one will affect the others. The Kinesiologist assessing their client's current state of health will look at all three aspects of the Triad of Health, and will take into account, their clients lifestyle and environment, diet - allergies or addictions, emotional disposition as well as their client’s physical symptoms.</p>

                            <h2>Physical stress can affect the mental and emotional state, as well as the biochemistry of the body.</h2>
                            <p>When an incorrect posture becomes a natural posture certain muscles are overused and become weak, and their ability to receive and send information to the central nervous system is altered. Also the energy to maintain a contraction is gradually reduced which can create instability at the joints. The brain senses the stress and sends a message to ‘switch off’ the overused muscles and other muscles become tight as a form of protection for the body.</p>
                            <p>Pinched blood vessels and locked joints caused by incorrect posture can occur causing muscle tension and inflammation, and a range of body movements become difficult, painful and stressful. They will restrict the flow of blood and decrease the supply of nutrients to the tissues and organs of the body, and as a result alter the production of hormones released into the bloodstream changing the chemical balance of the body, which in turn will add to the aches and pains. and this in turn will further affect the mood or emotional state of the client.</p>

                            <h2>The biochemistry of the body can effect the emotions as well as the physical body.</h2>
                            <p>Diet plays a big role in how the body functions and the correct food balance is essential to repair and build the tissues of the body for conversion into heat and energy. A healthy diet contains natural food sugars in fruits, grains, dairy foods and vegetables for example, but when a diet is high in added sugar and carbohydrates health problems can occur.</p>
                            <p>The body tries to keep a constant supply of glucose for the cells of the body by maintaining a constant glucose concentration in the blood (function of the Pancreas). For the short term, the consumption of sugar raises the blood sugar level producing a burst of energy. To balance this extreme surge of blood sugar, the pancreas then overproduces insulin which drastically lowers the blood sugar level which can cause headaches, tiredness and anxiety, and, the more sugar taken into the body the more the body craves it to produce that burst of energy.</p>
                            <p>A diet high in added sugar will cause the production of higher levels of insulin, blood glucose becomes unstable which can lead to hypoglycemia, a condition that is characterised by fluctuating emotions of extreme highs and extreme lows leading to feelings of exhaustion and depression. Sustained high levels of insulin in the body, through a diet high in sugar, can result in the cells becoming insulin resistant, which over time can contribute to diabetes, obesity and heart disease.</p>

                            <p>In times of stress it will send out warning signals that all is not well, signals such as feeling tired, or a headache, or aches and pains, or digestive problems. Unfortunately we do not always listen to these warning signals, and we do not give our bodies time to relax and heal, perhaps we take a painkiller for the aches and pains and carry on, creating further physical/emotional symptoms.</p>
                            <p>The aim of the Kinesiologist is to bring all aspects of the Triad of Health into balance, giving attention to all three aspects will reveal the hidden cause of their client's symptoms.</p>
