                            <h2>What is Kinesiology?</h2>
                            <p>The word Kinesiology comes from the Greek “kinesis” meaning motion. Kinesiology is a holistic approach to health care which uses gentle manual muscle testing to communicate directly with the body. The Kinesiologist aims to identify the underlying cause of energy imbalance in the body by looking at health from three aspects; the chemical / nutritional, physical / structural and mental and emotional, referred to as the Triad of Health thus restoring balance to the person as a “whole”.</p>

                            <h2>The development of Kinesiology</h2>
                            <p>Kinesiology has its roots in Applied Kinesiology which began with research from the philosophy of chiropractic. Dr. George Goodheart, an American chiropractor created Applied Kinesiology in the 1960's. A keen observer and brilliant systematic researcher led him to discover some muscles were weakened by poor nutrition and circulation. He then discovered the link between the lymphatic system, the muscles, Chapman’s reflex points, and the connection between the muscles and Bennett's reflex points which stimulate vascular flow.</p>
                            <p>Further research led him to look at the body's energy flow via the meridians, as explained by Traditional Chinese acupuncturists and he found there was a relationship between a specific muscle response and a specific meridian. And as the Chinese had named the meridians after the organ or gland they were associated with, he realised the organ or gland was the key in this relationship; when the organ system was stressed, the muscle may develop an imbalance (weakness), the Chapman reflex point may become tender, the Bennett reflex point may become active, and the associated meridian flow may be disturbed.</p>

                            <h2>Muscle testing</h2>
                            <p>The Kinesiologist uses an Indicator Muscle (IM) test as an assessment tool to tap into the body's own innate knowledge, allowing it to identify possible problems and whether energy is flowing or blocked for what is being assessed. This can be food or any stimulus placed on the body. When the muscle tests as “strong” this indicates the energy circuit is clear, when it tests as “weak” this indicates the energy is blocked.</p>
                            <p>The IM test also shows the Kinesiologist what is needed to treat and correct any imbalances found in the assessment. Kinesiology uses specific massage points, nutrition, energy reflexes, emotional techniques, and incorporates some of the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine to encourage the body's self healing, to restore health and well-being physically, mentally and emotionally to create a state of health and harmony in the body as a “whole”.</p>

                            <p>The list of problems it can help or alleviate is endless. Not only can Kinesiology treat a problem when it has arisen, regular use of Kinesiology can prevent a build up of imbalances which may have led to problems in the future had they been neglected.</p>
