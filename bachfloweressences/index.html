                            <h2>How do Bach Flower Essences work?</h2>
                            <p>Bach Flower Essences have the quality and ability to change a negative emotion into a positive one.

                            <p>Negative emotions are not suppressed but turned into the opposite positive emotional state. For example, fear of failure into self-confidence or impatience into calmness and tranquillity.</p>
