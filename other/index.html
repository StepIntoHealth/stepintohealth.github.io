                            <h2>What is Candida?</h2>
                            <p>Candida is a usually harmless yeast organism that exists naturally in our bodies living on the skin and mucous membranes and has long been recognised as the cause of thrush. Growing evidence worldwide states that yeasts such as Candida may be responsible for a wide range of medical disorders and that the incidence of yeast related illness is increasing. There are over 150 species of Candida; the most common being Candida Albicans.</p>
                            <p>In a healthy person, Candida (controlled by the immune system and ‘friendly’ bacteria) is a non-invasive organism, however, when the delicate balance of yeasts and bacteria in the body is disturbed Candida Albicans overgrowth can occur.</p>

                            <h2>Why is Candida overgrowth a problem?</h2>
                            <p>As the numbers of Candida increase, the Candida shifts from its yeast state to a fungal state. The fungus establishes itself in the gut and alters the digestive environment; the pH becomes more acidic meaning that the absorption of vitamins and minerals stops, the production of digestive enzymes slows, friendly bacteria struggle to survive and the fungus flourishes. The result being that as the fungus grows, your body weakens.</p>
                            <p>Once established in the gut, the Candida produces root-like structures called Rhizoids. Rhizoids penetrate the gut wall, creating microscopic holes, which allow undigested food particles, toxins, bacteria and yeast to enter the bloodstream. This stage is known as Leaky Gut Syndrome. The Candida spores can now create colonies outside the gut, in fact anywhere it can reach via the bloodstream. They first target low-oxygen areas, but can eventually settle in almost every organ in the body inhibiting its function and can also cause bacterial infections.</p>

                                <li><p><strong>A weakened immune system</strong> – allergies or intolerances, excess sugar consumption, emotional stress and environmental pollutions all contribute towards a weakened immune system.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Medication</strong> – so many medications affect the delicate balance of your body; the long term use of medications such as antibiotics, steroids, contraceptive pills and hormones. Antibiotics whilst they kill germs, they also kill the friendly bacteria in your gut – the same friendly bacteria that normally keeps your Candida under control.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Mould</strong> – exposure to mouldy environments can encourage Candida growth – mould on foods such as cheese and mushrooms, and mould spores, once inhaled, can travel throughout the body.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Yeast</strong> – found in wine and beer, bread, dried fruit and over ripe fruit, grapes, vinegar Marmite and Bovril</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – pregnancy will alter your body’s hormonal balance, sugar production and pH; the acid/alkaline balance in the body.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                                    <p><strong>Poor diet</strong> – the modern trend towards diet is fast food and processed foods seriously lacking in fibre and important vitamins, yet high in refined carbohydrates, sugar and a bombardment of additives, colourants and chemicals (with the chemical sprays on crops). It is the responsibility of the immune system to identify and destroy the harmful substances.</p>
                                    <p>Fibre is an important part of a healthy diet as it keeps everything moving through your gut nicely and produces fatty acids that hamper the growth of Candida.</p>
                                    <p>Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium and Selenium are essential for a healthy immune system; of these, vitamin C is the most important to consume regularly as the body does not store it. B vitamins, in particular Biotin, are essential to controlling Candida overgrowth.</p>
                                    <p>A diet containing nuts, whole grains, high quality fish, shellfish and meat will contain all of these essential vitamins, whilst a diet high in foods such as refined carbohydrates, yeast, refined sugars, fruit sugars, vinegar and fermented foods will encourage your Candida to flourish.</p>
